# My-dotfiles

My AwesomeWm, DWM and Qtile desktop dotfiles

## Welcome

This is my repo for the dotfiles. When I first created this repo, it was for the
dotfiles of my qtile desktop, but after I began to experiment with AwesomeWM,
I've added AwesomeWM to the repo. Now I've also added DWM to it. I will be
keeping all the WMs up to date, but primarily DWM because it is currently my
daily driver.

Basic orientation around file scructure:

1. **Docs** - is directory where are stored all of docs about every file in this repo and about scripts (how they work)
2. **Bin** - is directory where are all the scripts that the user can run if they want my dotfiles
3. **Scripts** - is directory only for maintainer where are all scripts that I use to maintain the repo
4. **config** - is directory where are all config dirs are required to be put in **_$HOME/.config/_** dir
5. **usr** - is directory where all config dirs are required to be put in **_/usr/_** dir

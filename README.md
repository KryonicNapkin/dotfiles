# My-dotfiles
My qtile desktop dotfiles

If you want all of my packages then run my script called "pkg-installed.sh"
End you can then edit the file "pkglist.txt" file to add or remove the packages you want to installed on your system.

You must make the script file executable by typing "cd My-dotfiles && chmod +x pkg-installed.sh" into the command line.

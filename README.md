# My-dotfiles

My Qtile, AwesomeWm and Dwm desktop dotfiles

## Welcome

This is my repo for the dotfiles. When I first created this repo, it was for the
dotfiles of my qtile desktop, but after
I began to experiment with AwesomeWM  so I've settled on Awesome because it's
the most
customizable WM and I like to fiddle with all the options. I will be keeping
Qtile still maintained but less than Awesome. I think all of the wms that I
tried were good, but I began experimenting with suckless software and first
software that I wanted to try was Dwm. I like Dwm because it's minimal and
written in C.

Basic orientation around folder scructure:

1. **Docs** - is directory where are stored all of docs about every file in this repo and about scripts (how they work)
2. **Bin** - is directory where are all the scripts that the user can run if they want my qtile desktop
3. **Scripts** - is directory only for maintainer where are all scripts that I use to maintain the repo
4. **config** - is directory where are all config dirs are required to be put in **_$HOME/.config/_** dir
5. **usr** - is directory where all config dirs are required to be put in **_/usr/_** dir

# My-dotfiles
My qtile desktop dotfiles

Basic orientation around folder scructure: 
1. **Docs** - is directory where are stored all of docs about every file in this repo and about scripts (how they work)
2. **Bin** - is directory where are all the scripts that the user can run if they want my qtile desktop
3. **Scripts** - is directory only for maintainer where are all scripts that I use to maintain the repo 
4. **config.d** - is directory where are all config dirs are required to be put in ***$HOME/.config/*** dir 
5. **usr.d** - is directory where all config dirs are required to be put in ***/usr/*** dir
6. **etc.d** - is directory where all config dirs are required to be put in ***/etc/*** dir

## Software that I use:
* **Distro**               == [Archlinux](https://archlinux.org/)
* **WM (Window Manager)**  == [Qtile](https://qtile.org/)

* **Terminal**             == [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
* **Shell**                == Zsh ([modified ChristianChiarulli's zsh configuration](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/Machfiles/tree/master/zsh))
* **Text Editor**          == Moustly [Lunarvim](https://lunarvim.org/) but for the rofi-configs script [Astronvim](https://astronvim.github.io/), because lvim does not want to start by qtile keybinding
* **Compositor**           == Picom ([picom-ibhagwan-git](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom))
* **Application launcher** == Rofi ([adi1090x's rofi colection](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi))

# My-dotfiles
My Qtile and AwesomeWm desktop dotfiles

## Welcome
This is my repo for the dotfiles. When I first created this repo, it was for the dotfiles of my qtile desktop, but after I began to experiment with AwesomeWM and more window managers so I settled on Awesome because I wanted something minimal, customizable and written in C, because I don't really like python but I don't mind it either. 
I will be keeping Qtile still maintained but less than Awesome.

Basic orientation around folder scructure: 
1. **Docs** - is directory where are stored all of docs about every file in this repo and about scripts (how they work)
2. **Bin** - is directory where are all the scripts that the user can run if they want my qtile desktop
3. **Scripts** - is directory only for maintainer where are all scripts that I use to maintain the repo 
4. **config.d** - is directory where are all config dirs are required to be put in ***$HOME/.config/*** dir 
5. **usr.d** - is directory where all config dirs are required to be put in ***/usr/*** dir
6. **etc.d** - is directory where all config dirs are required to be put in ***/etc/*** dir
